## Overview

Welcome to the Art Engine 2.0 developer documentation! The Art Engine is a powerful
npm package that enables artists and developers to create various forms of NFT art and
metadata. It achieves this flexibility by utilizing a plugin-based system, allowing
users to combine different plugins to produce diverse and unique media files.

The engine executes these plugins in a predefined order to generate desired content.
With the Art Engine, you can leverage the included CORE plugins or even build your
own custom plugins to extend its capabilities.
