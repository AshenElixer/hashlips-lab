## Overview

Welcome to the Art Engine 2.0 developer documentation! The Art Engine is a powerful
npm package that enables artists and developers to create various forms of NFT art and
metadata. It achieves this flexibility by utilizing a plugin-based system, allowing
users to combine different plugins to produce diverse and unique media files.

The engine executes these plugins in a predefined order to generate desired content.
With the Art Engine, you can leverage the included CORE plugins or even build your
own custom plugins to extend its capabilities.

### A Brief History

The foundation of the Art Engine 2.0 was inspired by the OG HashLips Art Engine, an earlier version that gained immense popularity during the rise of NFTs. Originally available at [https://github.com/HashLips/hashlips_art_engine](https://github.com/HashLips/hashlips_art_engine), this precursor to the Art Engine 2.0 was designed with a primary focus on creating images and metadata for ERC721 NFTs. As its user base expanded rapidly, enthusiastic users suggested numerous features and enhancements. However, due to its initial design, adding new features while maintaining code readability became increasingly challenging.

To address these challenges and pave the way for future growth and extensibility, the Art Engine 2.0 was born. The core idea behind the Art Engine 2.0 was to adopt a plugin-based approach, allowing users not only to make use of the core plugins but also to create their own plugins and openly share them with the community. This shift to a plugin-centric architecture enables seamless integration of new features, facilitates code maintenance, and encourages collaborative development.
