# Quick Start

## Installation Process

To get started with the Art Engine 2.0, follow these simple steps:

### Dependencies

Before proceeding, ensure that you have Node.js installed on your system, as well as npm, the Node.js package manager. You can download Node.js from the official website: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)

### Installation

You can install the Art Engine npm package by running the following command:

```shell copy
npm install @hashlips-lab/art-engine
```

> If you wish to explore the Art Engine's source code or contribute to its development, you can find the repository on GitHub: [Art Engine Repository](https://github.com/hashlips-lab/hashlips-lab/tree/main/packages/art-engine)

> You can also find the NPM package here: [Art Engine NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hashlips-lab/art-engine)

## Usage

### Adding the Art Engine

In this example, we'll initialize the Art Engine 2.0 without plugins thats why you see empty input objects, generators array, renderers array, and exporters array.

```ts copy
const { ArtEngine } = require("@hashlips-lab/art-engine");

const BASE_PATH = __dirname;

const ae = new ArtEngine({
  cachePath: `${BASE_PATH}/cache`,
  outputPath: `${BASE_PATH}/output`,
  useCache: false,

  inputs: {},

  generators: [],

  renderers: [],

  exporters: [],
});

(async () => {
  // Run the Art Engine
  await ae.run();
  // Print performance metrics
  await ae.printPerformance();
})();
```

- We set up the `cachePath` and `outputPath` to specify the paths where the Art Engine will cache temporary data and save the generated artwork, respectively. The `useCache` option is set to `false`, meaning the Art Engine will not use cached data during the current run.

- `await ae.run();` executes the Art Engine, and since there are no plugins defined, the Art Engine will complete the process without generating any actual artwork.
- `await ae.printPerformance();` prints the performance metrics after the run, providing insights into the processing time and resource usage.

### Adding plugins

Below is a usage example demonstrating how to use the Art Engine 2.0 to create NFT art by combining different CORE plugins. This example will load image layers as inputs, generate attributes for each item, render the layers on top of each other, and export the artwork and metadata. For a more detailed understanding, you can check out the example repository that implements this template: [Art Engine Template Repository](https://github.com/hashlips-lab/art-engine-template)

```ts copy
const {
  ArtEngine,
  inputs,
  generators,
  renderers,
  exporters,
} = require("@hashlips-lab/art-engine");

const BASE_PATH = __dirname;

const ae = new ArtEngine({
  cachePath: `${BASE_PATH}/cache`,
  outputPath: `${BASE_PATH}/output`,
  useCache: false,

  inputs: {
    // Define the input plugin (ImageLayersInput) to load image layers
    apes: new inputs.ImageLayersInput({
      assetsBasePath: `${BASE_PATH}/data`,
    }),
  },

  generators: [
    // Define the generator plugin (ImageLayersAttributesGenerator) to generate attributes for each item
    new generators.ImageLayersAttributesGenerator({
      dataSet: "apes",
      startIndex: 1,
      endIndex: 10,
    }),
  ],

  renderers: [
    // Define the renderer plugins to render the attributes and image layers
    new renderers.ItemAttributesRenderer({
      name: (itemUid) => `Ape ${itemUid}`,
      description: (attributes) => {
        return `This is a token with "${attributes["Background"][0]}" as Background`;
      },
    }),
    new renderers.ImageLayersRenderer({
      width: 2048,
      height: 2048,
    }),
  ],

  exporters: [
    // Define the exporter plugins to export the generated artwork and metadata
    new exporters.ImagesExporter(),
    new exporters.Erc721MetadataExporter({
      imageUriPrefix: "ipfs://__CID__/",
    }),
    new exporters.SolMetadataExporter({
      imageUriPrefix: "ipfs://__CID__/",
      symbol: "APES",
      sellerFeeBasisPoints: 200,
      collectionName: "The Apes",
      creators: [
        {
          address: "__SOLANA_WALLET_ADDRESS_HERE__",
          share: 100,
        },
      ],
    }),
  ],
});

(async () => {
  // Run the Art Engine to generate the artwork
  await ae.run();
  // Print performance metrics
  await ae.printPerformance();
})();
```

- **Inputs** serve as a bridge or adapter, allowing the Art Engine to read and utilize multiple types of data. They act as the source of content for generating artwork. Depending on the input plugin used, you can load data such as images from files, Photoshop files, music files, videos, and more. Multiple inputs can be provided to the Art Engine, offering flexibility in handling diverse data sources.

- **Generators** are responsible for creating attributes or properties for each item in the artwork. They play a vital role in generating variations and unique features for each piece of art. Depending on the generator used, they also define the quantity of media files to be generated. Multiple generators can be added to produce various attributes and media files for the artwork.

- **Renderers** take the attributes generated by the generators and combine them with the input data to produce the final visual representation of the artwork. They also utilize temporary storage to render the metadata and media files.

- **Exporters** utilize the data from the renderers and temporary storage to export your media files to the desired location. Additionally, they act as the last step for data or media manipulation to achieve the desired output. Exporters play a critical role in finalizing the generated artwork and metadata.

Throughout the documentation, we will explore each of these components in detail, providing code examples, plugin configurations, and best practices for their effective utilization.
