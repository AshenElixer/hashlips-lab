# Inputs Interface

All input plugins in the Art Engine implement the `InputInterface<InputDataType>` interface. This interface defines the basic structure that an input plugin should follow.

```ts copy
interface InputInterface<InputDataType> {
  init: (props: InputInitPropsInterface) => Promise<void>;
  load: () => Promise<InputDataType>;
}
```

- `InputInterface<InputDataType>`: This is the main interface for an input plugin. It's parameterized with a generic type, `InputDataType`, which represents the type of data that the input plugin will produce.
- `init(props: InputInitPropsInterface) => Promise<void>`: This method is used to initialize the input plugin. It takes an object of type `InputInitPropsInterface` as an argument, which contains the seed. The method returns a promise that resolves when the initialization is complete.
- `load() => Promise<InputDataType>`: This method is responsible for loading and retrieving the input data. It returns a promise that resolves to an object of type `InputDataType`, which is the actual input data produced by the plugin.

```ts copy
interface InputInitPropsInterface {
  seed: string;
}
```

`InputInitPropsInterface`: This is an interface that defines the properties required to initialize an input plugin. In this case, there's a single property defined:

- `seed`: This is a string value that serves as a seed for deterministic behavior. The seed can be used to ensure that the same input plugin produces the same output when initialized with the same seed.
