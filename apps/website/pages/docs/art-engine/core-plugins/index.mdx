# Core Plugins Overview

The Art Engine 2.0 comes with a powerful set of core plugins that facilitate the generation of NFT art and metadata. These core plugins are divided into four categories: inputs, generators, renderers, and exporters. Each category serves a distinct role in the art generation process.

## Plugins types

### Inputs

The `inputs` are responsible for loading and providing data to the Art Engine. They act as a bridge or adapter, enabling the engine to read and utilize various types of data. Depending on the input plugin used, you can load data from different sources such as images from files, Photoshop files, music files, videos, and more. This flexibility allows artists and developers to work with diverse data formats and sources to create unique NFT art.

### Generators

The `generators` play a key role in the art generation process by creating attributes or properties for each item in the artwork. They generate variations and unique features for the NFTs, making each piece distinct and appealing. Depending on the generator used, you can define the quantity of media files to be generated, enabling efficient and dynamic NFT creation.

### Renderers

The `renderers` combine the attributes generated by the generators with the input data to produce the final visual representation of the artwork. They determine how the attributes and media files are combined to create the desired visual effect. Additionally, renderers leverage temporary storage for rendering the metadata and media files during the generation process.

### Exporters

The `exporters` handle the final output of the generated artwork and metadata. They export the media files and metadata in the desired formats, making them ready for use in NFT marketplaces and other platforms. Exporters also act as the last step for data or media manipulation to achieve the desired output.

## Understanding Plugin Interactions

It is important to note that different plugins within the Art Engine are designed to be used together, forming a cohesive ecosystem for NFT art generation. Each plugin is built with a specific output and interface in mind. Therefore, it is crucial to understand what a plugin outputs and how it interacts with other plugins.

For example, generators produce attributes that may be consumed by renderers to create meaningful metadata or used as input for other generators to add further complexity to the artwork. Similarly, exporters depend on the output generated by the renderers to produce the final media files and metadata in the desired formats.

To ensure a smooth art generation process, it is essential to comprehend the flow of data between plugins and the expected interfaces they use. The documentation for each core plugin will provide insights into its outputs, inputs, and how it fits within the larger context of the Art Engine's plugin-based architecture.

## Development Considerations

The Art Engine 2.0 is an actively developing tool, and new core plugins may be added over time to enhance its capabilities. As a result, updates to the Art Engine may introduce changes that could impact existing implementations. We recommend staying updated with the latest releases and following the documentation closely for any potential breaking changes.
