# Core Plugins

The Art Engine 2.0 comes with a powerful set of core plugins that facilitate the generation of NFT art and metadata. These core plugins are divided into four categories: inputs, generators, renderers, and exporters. Each category serves a distinct role in the art generation process.

## Plugins

### Inputs:

These plugins provide the initial data or inputs required for the art generation process. They feed data to the generators.

- [Image Layers Input Plugin](core-plugins/inputs/image-layers)

### Generators:

These plugins take the inputs from the input plugins and generate attribute data that will influence the appearance of the final artwork.

- [Image Layers Attributes Generator](core-plugins/generators/image-layers-attributes)

### Renderers:

These plugins take the generated attribute data from the generators and use it to create visual renders of the artwork.

- [Image Layers Renderer](core-plugins/renderers/image-layers)
- [Item Attributes Renderer](core-plugins/renderers/item-attributes)

### Exporters:

These plugins take the rendered artwork and metadata and export it into various formats suitable for different NFT platforms.

- [ERC721 Metadata Exporter](core-plugins/exporters/erc721-metadata)
- [Sol Metadata Exporter](core-plugins/exporters/sol-metadata)
- [Images Exporter](core-plugins/exporters/images)
