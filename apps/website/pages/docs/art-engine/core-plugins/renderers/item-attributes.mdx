# Item Attributes Renderer

The Item Attributes Renderer plugin serves as a crucial component in the Art Engine's rendering pipeline. Its primary function is to render the attributes generated during the artwork generation process in a human-readable and structured format. This rendered data can then be used by exporters and other downstream processes to understand and utilize the attributes associated with each generated artwork effectively.

## Adding the plugin

1.  Import the plugin object:

```ts copy
const { ArtEngine, renderers } = require("@hashlips-lab/art-engine");
```

2. Setup a base path:

```ts copy
const BASE_PATH = __dirname;
```

3. Add the plugin to an instance of the Art Engine:

```ts copy
const ae = new ArtEngine({
  cachePath: `${BASE_PATH}/cache`,
  outputPath: `${BASE_PATH}/output`,
  useCache: false,

  renderers: [
    new renderers.ItemAttributesRenderer({
      name: (itemUid: string) => `Artwork ${itemUid}`,
      description: (attributes) => `This artwork features ${attributes["Color"]} colors.`,
    });
    // Add more renderers if needed...
  ]

  // Add inputs, generators, and exporters as required...
});
```

## Parameters

- `name` (optional): A function that takes an item's unique ID (`itemUid`) as input and returns a custom name for the artwork associated with that item. If not provided, a default empty string will be used as the name.
- `description` (optional): A function that takes the rendered attributes as input and returns a custom description for the artwork based on those attributes. If not provided, a default empty string will be used as the description.
