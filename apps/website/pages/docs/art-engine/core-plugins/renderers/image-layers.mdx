# Image Layers Renderer

The Image Layers Renderer is a plugin designed to work with the Image Layers Generator of the Art Engine. Its purpose is to take the output generated by the Image Layers Generator, which consists of item attributes and their corresponding layered images, and render those layered images into temporary files. These temporary files can then be utilized for further processing or artwork creation.

## Adding the plugin

1.  Import the plugin object:

```ts copy
const { ArtEngine, renderers } = require("@hashlips-lab/art-engine");
```

2. Setup a base path:

```ts copy
const BASE_PATH = __dirname;
```

3. Add the plugin to an instance of the Art Engine:

```ts copy
const ae = new ArtEngine({
  cachePath: `${BASE_PATH}/cache`,
  outputPath: `${BASE_PATH}/output`,
  useCache: false,

  renderers: [
    new renderers.ImageLayersRenderer({
      width: 2048, // Specify the width of the rendered image
      height: 2048, // Specify the height of the rendered image
    });
    // Add more renderers if needed...
  ]

  // Add inputs, generators, and exporters as required...
});
```

## Parameters

- `width` (number): The width of the rendered image in pixels.
- `height` (number): The height of the rendered image in pixels.
- `imageProcessor` (optional): An optional custom image processor that implements the `ImageProcessorInterface`. If not provided, the default `SharpImageProcessor` will be used.
